# FitfnessWebpack

School project demonstrating the power of (almost) Vanilla JS compared to the countless frameworks out there (Angular, React, Vue, ...).

This is done using the following tech stack:
- (browser-native) Web Components + Custom Elements
- Lit `render` tagged template literal and `render` function 
- Redux, RxJS and immer to manage and subscribe to state
- Navigo router (dead simple)
- TypeScript and Webpack
